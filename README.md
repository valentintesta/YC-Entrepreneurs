# YC-Entrepreneurs

## Objective

I will conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to map the entrepreneurs who have been accepted into YC. Additionally, in the second section I'll analyze companies listed as "Top Companies" on the YC website.

##  Table of Content 

### **1 -  Educational Backgrounds Analysis: Career trajectories of Y Combinator founders.**
I will explore the distribution of educational institutions, analyze the years of study, and investigate the correlation between education and startup success.

### **2 - Analysis of Top Companies and Leading Founders in Y Combinator (YC)**

I will analyze various aspects such as industry categorization, years of study, and other relevant metrics.


## Conclusion


We can observe that most entrepreneurs joining Y Combinator come from a technology background, often with degrees from prestigious universities such as Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, among others. Additionally, the median entrepreneur has held more than two jobs and accumulated over five years of education (excluding high school).

When analyzing "Top Companies," we see a very similar background for their founders â€” they also predominantly hail from renowned universities and technology fields. One notable observation is that the median number of jobs held by founders of Top Companies increases to around four.

We also notice a significant gap between the number of companies that join Y Combinator and those that go on to become Top Companies, indicating that while being accepted into YC is a strong achievement, the path to reaching "top" status is much more complex.
